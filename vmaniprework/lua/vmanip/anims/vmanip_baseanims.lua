--[[ IN BOTH CASES: NAME SHOULD BE THE ACTUAL SEQUENCE NAME
You don't have to put every value, but some like model are obviously needed

Hands
"model" - path to model
"lerp_peak" - time when the hand should transition back to the weapon
"lerp_speed_in" - speed at which the hand transitions into the anim
"lerp_speed_out" - speed at which the hand transitions out of the anim
"lerp_curve" - power of the curve
"speed" - playback speed
"startcycle" - time to start the anim at
"cam_ang" - angle offset for the camera
"cam_angint" - intensity multiplier of the camera
"sounds" - table of sounds, keys represent the path and their value the time it plays at. do not use past holdtime lmao
"loop" - loop the anim instead of stopping
"segmented" - when anim is over, freezes it and waits for SegmentPlay(sequence,lastanim). Repeat if lastanim is false
^Note: lerp peak and related values are used for the "last segment" instead.

"holdtime" - the time when the anim should be paused
"preventquit" - ONLY accept QuitHolding request if the argument is our anim. Use very cautiously
"assurepos" - for important anims, makes sure the position isn't offset by sweps. Use locktoply it's better
"locktoply" - for when assurepos isn't enough.


Legs
"model" - path to model
"speed" - playback speed
"forwardboost" - forward offset
"upboost" - vertical offset (in actual hammer units)
