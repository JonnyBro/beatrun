# Beatrun | Community version

Infamous parkour addon for Garry's Mod, fully open sourced and maintained by the community.

**READ THE ***ENTIRE*** README BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS ON THE [beatrun.ru](https://beatrun.ru) DISCORD!**

This version does not include malicious modules, code or networking. What it does contain is:
* Lua modules for Discord Rich Presence
* Lua modules for Steam Presence
* Network connectivity for courses (activates only when you load or upload courses, and by default `courses.beatrun.ru` is used)

**All of this is optional and you may remove all of it. (modules are located [here](/lua/bin/) and online courses functionality is [here](/beatrun/gamemodes/beatrun/gamemode/cl/OnlineCourse.lua))**

## Automatic Installation (Windows only!)
Run the command below in Powershell.
> (Win + R > `powershell` > command in question)
```powershell
